          What is DevBlog and Why did I create this blog? Firstly, I would like to mention what I meant by saying that it is a dev blog it usually has one meaning which is software development blog, but in my case it has another meaning &amp;ldquo;self-development blog&amp;rdquo;, because I am still a young person to call myself a Software Developer or Computer Engineer, however I still can build my own projects and develop my knowledge, that is exactly why I was looking for a way to deploy this blog on &amp;ldquo;/blog&amp;rdquo; slug for 1 whole day.
