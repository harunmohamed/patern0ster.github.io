          Introduction ðŸŒ² This is a project builds positive tree by adding/multiplying elements in pairs from bottom to top and there are functions that I will be mentioning later. This project can be educative for people who are starting or currently using functional PL&amp;rsquo;s. I need to mention that this is an assignment done for a course in METU NCC. You can check full code here.

          What is DevBlog and Why did I create this blog? Firstly, I would like to mention what I meant by saying that it is a dev blog it usually has one meaning which is software development blog, but in my case it has another meaning &amp;ldquo;self-development blog&amp;rdquo;, because I am still a young person to call myself a Software Developer or Computer Engineer, however I still can build my own projects and develop my knowledge, that is exactly why I was looking for a way to deploy this blog on &amp;ldquo;/blog&amp;rdquo; slug for 1 whole day.
