<h2 id="what-is-devblog-and-why-did-i-create-this-blog">What is DevBlog and Why did I create this blog?</h2>
<p>Firstly, I would like to mention what I meant by saying that it is a dev blog it usually has one meaning which is software development blog, but in my case it has another meaning &ldquo;self-development blog&rdquo;, because I am still a young person to call myself a Software Developer or Computer Engineer, however I still can build my own projects and develop my knowledge, that is exactly why I was looking for a way to deploy this blog on &ldquo;/blog&rdquo; slug for 1 whole day. Just joking.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
In addittion what I said above, in this blog I don&rsquo;t only write posts about what have I done with projects. I will share my own experiences like where did I struggle in a project and how could I find a way out of my problems, because sometimes I can&rsquo;t find a solution just by writing my problem down to Google. I assume it is not just me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Last reason is that sometimes I really need motivation and I want to see that I am good at doing that stuff and get motivated because sometimes everyone can stuck and I like writing reports absurdly.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-plan-to-write-about">What do I plan to write about?</h2>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t plan too much, but I will mention what I do these days so you will have some ideas about what I can write about. Exactly for now I am learning the syntax of markdown that is why this post can go <strong><em>fancy</em></strong> (probably in a bad way :D). I will try lists and write about what I am doing these days.</p>
<ul>
<li>I hate <strong>Haskell</strong> so as a solution I have started to learn about how can I build a simple game with Haskell (a game similar to The Binding of Isaac).</li>
<li>We have a juicy course called Database Management Systems it is mostly about building a project using a DBMS so we decided to build a project for societies in our school with <strong>Django</strong>. I can give details in another post cause it would be long.</li>
<li>I am learning about development techniques.</li>
<li>Also having too much assignments if any interesting assignment comes it can be a post.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am mostly trying to learn about web technologies and other development stuff so if you are interested about one of these topics I will probably be writing weekly and probably share it from my personal social media accounts so See you for now.</p>
